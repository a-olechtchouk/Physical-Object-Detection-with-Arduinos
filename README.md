# Physical-Object-Detection-with-Arduinos
Uses two Aruidno's and a nRF24L01+ to communicate between each other. One Arduino communicates the distance it is to an object using multiple rangefinders, and the other receives this information, plays a sound if the object is too close, and displays the results in a 7-segment display.
